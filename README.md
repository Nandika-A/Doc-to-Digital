# Doc to Digital

## Project Description
Our project aims to revolutionize the way we interact with educational and informational content by converting static documents into engaging movies and interactive games. We recognize that visual learning is not only more captivating but also significantly more effective in aiding comprehension and retention. 
By leveraging advanced technologies in multimedia and interactive design, our platform seamlessly transforms text-heavy documents, such as textbooks, research papers, or instructional guides, into dynamic visual experiences.

## Features
### 1. Visual Movie Creation:
Our platform converts static documents into dynamic movies by generating images and overlaying them with synchronized audio summaries. This approach provides a captivating way to convey information, making complex topics more accessible and engaging.
### 2. Interactive Q&A Game:
In the game component, users interact with a 3D character who quizzes them on key concepts extracted from the PDF. This interactive format encourages active participation and reinforces learning through question-answer interactions.
### 3. Enhanced Explanation:
The combination of visual imagery and synchronized audio narration ensures a comprehensive explanation of document content, facilitating better understanding and retention.
